# RSSI-based-Algorithm-for-ILS-using-BLE

This is a new Algo in development, the aim is to have better accuracy compared to 

Sadowski, S., & Spachos, P. (2018). RSSI-Based indoor localization with the internet	 
IEEE Access 6(1), 149â€“301.	https://doi.org/10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2843325

All the setup and dataset is based on that paper.
The author used only average and trilateration on sampled 100 values.
-We have improved the accuracy to 4% using our algorithm, more can be achieved using the concept of Machine Learning
The developed algorithm studies the distribution sample before making decision.

This is a python learning repository and will be improved with new concepts to achieve higher accuracy on the  availble dataset


TODO: The equidistant points gives better estimations than the other points
